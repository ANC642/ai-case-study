# TITLE
	“Maritime Cybersecurity”

## Overview and Origin	
* Name of company 
Fathom5 

* When was the company incorporated?
	January 29, 2018

* Who are the founders of the company?
	Zac Staples and Maura Sullivan Ph.D.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
	While he was in the Naval Postgraduate school, he led a team mixed with Ph.D.’s, graduate students and technical staff in a R&D of national and Navy specific cyberspace capabilities. The team created an Engineering Enclave for Maritime Security, a first-of-its-kind lab to conduct scientific research into the electronic reliability and maritime cybersecurity of shipboard navigation and control system electronics. 
	This will help create a stronger Cyber physical infrastructure and prevent cyber attacks on vessels and ship malfunction.   

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
	The company is funded by both private and public sectors.  Currently the revenue for the company is over $10.6 million. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	Fathom5 vision is towards maritime technology and cyber defense innovations. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
	The company teamed up with Dragos to support public or private business with their cybersecurity platforms.  According to McKinsey there is $2 million dollars for cybersecurity technology and $12.3 billion for Maritime security. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	Other companies do not offer Maritime cybersecurity. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
	Fathom5 specializes in creating testbeds for any situation.


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
	Company is in maritime digital Integration and cybersecurity services. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&10 years?
	Maritime cyber-attacks have rose to 400%. Many companies are implementing network detection tools and AI to locate malicious behaviors on their networks. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
	SonicWall, Premier Continuum, Noria Group; and ID Agent.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	Teaming up with Dragos cyber company, which helped them fortify maritime cybersecurity. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? 
	Fathom5 uses a security first approach that help them build a solution for every stage. Which includes ideation, engineering, testing and continuous deployment. This has help them achieve a high resilience in response to cyber disturbance and reduce the cost.  

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
	
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
	I would suggest they offer autonomous vehicles for land and sea. They can implement self-driving cars that communicate with each other when on the road to reduce the risk of car accidents and use the same technology for ships to reduce the chances of ships colliding with each other or crashing into an obstacle. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	Majority of vehicles already have hardware and software installed in them which will reduce the cost. They can update the technology with AI capabilities (NPL, Generative and Neural networks) for a safer driving experience and reduce fatal accidents and insurance cost. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	Since most cars already have sensors, network capabilities and cameras installed they will just need to have some hardware to be able to handle networking and software being installed. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	With mesh technology in play this will distribute network traffic to the best performance so the vehicles can communicate faster and prevent accidents.
